# Breakout-on-HTML5-Canvas

A ball, a paddle, and some bricks! Everyone love Breakout!

Super basic HTML page that relies on jQuery (included) and a js file to operate the Canvas.

All the magic happens in canvas.js

There is a function called makeBricks() that creates the layout for the bricks of the game. This is the function you can modify to make new levels of the game.

NOTE NOTE NOTE:
All the logic is not done yet. If a brick is hit from top or bottom, it works. But if it hits bricks from side, it wigs out. I'm working on that.
